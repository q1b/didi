# World seems simple .
> I am a student who passed 12th class without exams ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜Ž.
    
I like to not hurt other, instead I am ready to take their pain on myself 
for their shake until and unless they aren't hurting others for their 
own need .

Meditation is the one of the first way through which our ancient world
introduced themselves to universe, and Universe get introduced to them .
Vice-Versa

Now, why meditation is different from everything, 
Meditation is a way to interact with our own body .
Yes, Meditation helps you control yourself and maintain balance
between all your body parts . Balance can be co-related with positive energy or 
harmony , 

Now you read all above line and understand that then,
What is science behind that all ?
What is God ?
Why we are here ?
Why you are here ?
Why we die ?
Is this reality isn't a dream ?

Our mind starts ask questions,
And Every points question puts you towards the same question ,
What is reason for this or that ?

Then, what is real answer I think real answer has also some reason to be there,
And that reason also has some reason ... 

Now, Might you think I am mad, and you should think that way around as well,

I might tell you something further but that thing has no point until you
see or feel it yourself and If you want to do feel that __happiness__ which is 
__undiminishable__
 
> For which you should have to, do your sudarshan kriya regularly, and be happy .
